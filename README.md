# AnkoBasicCalculator
An extremely basic calculator written in the Anko library for Kotlin.

## Purpose
This app serves as a small sample of the power of Kotlin's handy Anko library! 

The anko library is rather low on documentation and examples. This project has been written 
to provide a small sample of what an application using Kotlin/Anko might look like.
